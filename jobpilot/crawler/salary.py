"""Turning a published salary label into numbers you can plot.

``vietnam.parse_salary`` already decides whether a string *is* a salary. This
goes one step further and extracts the figures, because "20 - 60 triệu" and
"1,500-2,500 USD" cannot be compared, bucketed or averaged as text — and a
market page whose central question is "what does this pay" needs them as
numbers.

Three things it refuses to do, all for the same reason: a wrong number is worse
than no number.

* **No guessing the currency.** A bare "20 - 60" could be millions of VND or
  dollars an hour. Without a marker the answer is ``None``.
* **No guessing the period.** Vietnamese ads quote monthly; US remote boards
  quote yearly. Unmarked defaults to monthly *only* for VND, where it is the
  near-universal convention, and is left explicit for everything else.
* **No inventing a midpoint.** "Up to 3000 USD" has no minimum. It stays
  ``None`` rather than becoming 0, which would drag every average down.
